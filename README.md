Book Importer

GoodReads.com is an excellent website for tracking the books you have read, the ones you want to read, and so on.
However if you're like me, you may have been tracking your books yourself with a spreadsheet.
GoodReads has its own importer, but unfortunately ISBN is required for it to work.
And I doubt many people bothered to record the ISBN of books they read.
So this will import books for you, and all it needs is a csv file with authors in the first column and titles in the second.
It will even record the GoodReads ID and ISBN for you if you want it too.

Run with 'python bookimporter.py'
